Suggestion for sequence in electronics intro:

First have them make circuits with battery and LED's.  Discuss and experiment with colors, number of led's, direction, and other.

Then use the Arduino boards and white push-in circuitboards to make circuits.  Continue discussion.  Use multimeter to learn about voltage in a circuit.  Arduino boards used as batteries.  We will pre-load the Arduinos with a program that makes two pins 'blink'. The pre-loaded blink program is used to make LED blink.  No programming needed yet, but we can show them at some point later how to change the program to blink with different timing.

Run a motor with the Arduino board, either directly or using circuitboards.  Find out how to make motor run forwards and backwards.  Discover that the Arduino board pins that are able to make the LED blink cannot drive motor directly.

</figure>

To get motor to "blink", we need a motor driver. Use a motor driver on the circuitboard.  See how to make motor run forward and backwards using this driver.  Use built-in blink to make motor start and stop.  Maybe make motor go both ways using a second "blink" pin.

If we want to make a project (robot, kinetic sculpture, vehicle...) we need a way to make it smaller and more secure, and need a battery!  First step is smaller.  With the XIAO modules, we can put it all on one board.

</figure>

Next step is to solder everything onto a little proto-board, and include a battery that can be charged using the XIAO's built-in charger.  This will involve stripping wires, soldering, and manipulating little parts.  We'll see how much of this we have time to do with them.  It may be that they won't have time do this, but will be motivated. I can leave you with a good example of how it is done for them to use in later classes.

Now that they have a board with a battery, they can make projects that incorporate motors or LED's that can be charged using a USB charger, and can run independently.  Below is a little cart that I made using a box that contained a bar of soap.  I call it the "soap box derby".
